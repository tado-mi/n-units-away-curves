\section{Existence and Uniqueness}

\begin{theorem}

  Given a twice differentiable function $f(x)$ whose second derivative is continuous and some $N \in \mathbb{R}$, $\exists$ exactly one unique $N$-Units Away Curve associated with that function.

\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}

  Consider the parametric formula for the $N$-Units Away Curve to $y = f(x)$: \firstFormula

  Since $f$ is both continuous and differentiable for $\forall t \in \mathbb{R}$, both $f(t)$ and $f'(t)$ necessarily exist as unique finite real values. Thus this gives that $\forall t, \exists$ exactly
  one unique associated point on the $N$-Units Away Curve. That same reasoning applied $\forall t \in (- \infty, \infty)$ gives us that the $N$-Units Away Curve exists and is unique.

\end{proof}
