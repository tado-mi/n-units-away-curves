\section{Acknowledgements}

The research for this paper was tremendously assisted by my three math major companions John Ennis, Dustin Kelser, and Tyler Perlman. Each contributed their own crucial little pieces along the way. I can’t thank them enough.

A profound thank you to both Mike Taylor and Professor Jannick Rolland in the Optics department. The conversations I had with each were fascinating and very helpful.

A very big thank you to Professor Stephen Kleene for overseeing this project and allowing me to do this little course as an independent study.

And lastly above all else, I’d love to dedicate this paper to Mr. Stephen Swiniarski, my beloved high school math teacher who first really delved into $N$-Units Away Curves with me. His enthusiasm and love for this ridiculous subject will never be forgotten.
