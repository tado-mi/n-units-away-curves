# N-Units Away Curves

The following repository is an attempt to learn more LaTeX, while typing up an interesting mathematics paper. Improvements are expected both for the code and the contents of the paper.<br/>

It is a collaboration of sorts. The author of the paper is **Orion Haunstrup**, as mentioned in `main.tex`.<br/>

To compile the paper, run `pdflatex main.tex` on the terminal. (if that is too much of a hustle, you can clone the repository also to [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), which will compile the tex to pdf).
